The `mpbn` Python module offers a simple implementation of reachability and attractor analysis in *Most Permissive Boolean Networks* ([arXiV:1808.10240][1]).

It is built on the `minibn` module from [colomoto-jupyter](https://github.com/colomoto/colomoto-jupyter) which allows importation of Boolean networks in many formats. See https://colomoto.org/notebook.
